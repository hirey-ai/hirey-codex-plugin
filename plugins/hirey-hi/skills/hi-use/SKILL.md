name: hi-use
description: Use Hirey Hi inside Codex for people-to-people work — post listings, match candidates, search, start pairings, schedule meetings. Use whenever the user asks to find, recruit, match, reach out to, pair with, or meet anyone (job candidate, tenant, friend, date, cofounder, investor, lawyer, etc.), AND `hi_agent_status` already reports `connected:true` + `activated:true`. If not connected yet, go to the `hi-onboard` skill first.

# Hi Use (post-onboarding workflows, Codex)

Once Hi is connected (the default setup writes a stable `hi_ak_` key into `~/.codex/config.toml` via `curl -fsSL https://hi.hirey.ai/v1/install/codex.sh | bash`, with `codex mcp login hi` only as the OAuth fallback — see `hi-onboard` / `hi-stable-key`) and Codex has been restarted, Codex sees Hi as a first-class tool surface. Every business tool below comes from Hi's live public capability catalog — names and schemas are authoritative.

## Use when

- `hi_agent_status` reports `connected:true` + `activated:true`
- the user asks anything in these shapes:
  - "find me X people for Y" (hiring, housing, friendship, dating, cofounder, investor, lawyer, etc.)
  - "post a job / listing / ad for …"
  - "reach out to candidate N from the last batch"
  - "set up a Zoom / phone call with …"
  - "what came back overnight?" / "any replies?"

## Tool map (loaded dynamically from Hi capability catalog)

| Intent | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Find a specific person / listing by NAME or free text** (anonymous, no listing needed) | `owners` | **`search`** with `q` (e.g. `q:"walter"` or `q:"founder building agent infra"`) — fuzzy + bilingual EN↔中文; searches profiles AND listings; returns `people[]` + `listings[]`. Use this for "搜一个叫 X 的人" / "find someone who does Y", NOT `matching_sessions.search` (that needs a published source listing). |
| Capture / update who the user is (name, headline, bio, location, links) | `owners` | actions: `update_profile`, `get`, `list_listings`, `peers_feed` — **call this first** before the first listing whenever the user has just introduced themselves |
| Publish a search ("I want to find …") | `agent_listings` | actions: `upsert`, `update_status`, `get`, `list`, `browse_recent` |
| See what matched | `matching_sessions` | actions: `match_feed`, `search`, `contact_match` (source listing must be published first) |
| Open a 1:1 thread with a matched person | `pairings` | actions: `create`, `timeline`, `contact_target` |
| Negotiate / schedule a meeting | `thread_meetings` | actions: `start`, `respond`, `get` |
| Host or discover public multi-party activities | `event_groups` | actions: `create`, `search`, `get`, `mine`, `mine_upcoming`, `join`, `leave`, `invite`, `announce`, `schedule_occurrence`, `cancel_occurrence`, `reschedule_occurrence`, `rsvp`, `rsvp_summary` |
| Browse the listing taxonomy (job kinds, housing kinds, …) | `listing_taxonomy` | read-only |
| Check credits / billing | `agent_credits` | read-only for most flows |
| Inbound events (replies, confirmations) | `hi_agent_events_wait` | long-poll; see `hi-events` skill |

If a tool you remember from this map is not in your live inventory, trust the live inventory — the catalog is the source of truth, this map may lag.

## Profile collection (call before the first listing)

The first time a user tells you anything profile-shaped — their name, role, where they are, a 1-line introduction, a website / LinkedIn — parse it and call `owners(action: "update_profile", …)` with whatever fields you can extract. Don't invent fields you weren't given (no fake titles, no fake locations). Bare minimum to write is `display_name` + `headline`; bio_markdown and location_text are nice-to-have but optional.

Why this matters: matching feeds and the first contact message sent on a pairing both include the sender's profile snippet on the wire. Without `display_name` + `headline` the counterpart sees "someone with a listing" instead of "Alex, San Francisco backend engineer who is hiring." Reply rates drop visibly.

A single user turn can carry both a profile and a listing in one breath — "I'm Alex, San Francisco backend 8y, looking to hire a senior frontend." Handle that as two tool calls in the same turn: `owners.update_profile` first (display_name="Alex", headline="San Francisco backend engineer, 8y"), then `agent_listings.upsert` for the hiring intent.

`update_profile` is self-scoped: caller can only edit their own owner profile. Don't pass `customer_id` trying to edit someone else — gateway returns 403.

## Discovery — "people you might be interested in"

If the user has finished onboarding and asks anything along the lines of "show me what's on Hi" / "any interesting people I could talk to?" / "browse around a bit," call `owners(action: "peers_feed", limit: 10)`. Returns `{items[], caller_profile_ready}`:

- `items[]` — owner profile cards (display_name + headline + location_text + avatar_url + owner_public_url + `suggested_because`). Surface 5–10 to the user. Don't paraphrase the fields — quote them as-is.
- `caller_profile_ready` — if `false`, the user's own profile is too sparse for the other side to take them seriously. Suggest a quick `owners.update_profile` before proceeding.

**Discovery is not a contact entry.** `peers_feed` returns owner identity, not listing IDs or selection keys. To actually reach out to one of these owners, both sides still need a listing → matching → contact_match flow. Don't try to pass `owner_public_id` into `pairings.create`; it won't bind.

## Default workflow (find people)

0. **Capture profile if the user just introduced themselves.** See the "Profile collection" section above. One `owners(action: "update_profile")` call, then continue.

1. **Clarify intent before calling anything.** Hi listings are durable and visible — do not publish on a vague hint. Ask the user for:
   - what kind of person (role, relationship, criteria)
   - hard filters (location, language, level, budget, age range as applicable)
   - any soft preferences worth ranking on
   - whether to post the listing now or hold off (a successful upsert is immediately live)

2. **Check taxonomy if you are unsure of category.** Call `listing_taxonomy` with the broadest hint; pick the closest `listing_kind` / `subkind`. Do not invent kinds.

3. **Create the listing.** `agent_listings(action: "upsert", listing_type_id, idempotency_key, text, target: { roles: [{role_type_id}], requirements: [{attribute_label, value_kind: "text", raw_value_text}] }, semantic_readiness_status: "ready")` → returns `listing_id`. There is **no separate draft/publish step** — a successful `upsert` is live. Use `update_status` (paused/closed) to retract. Report `listing_id` + public link if returned; never fabricate.

4. **Pull the match feed.** `matching_sessions(action: "match_feed", listing_id)` (or `action: "search", listing_id, query` to narrow by free text) returns `items[]` — ranked counterpart listings, each with a `selection_key`, the counterpart `listing_id` + `published_by_agent_id`, and an owner profile snippet. Surface the top 5–10 with structured fields, not paraphrase.

5. **On user pick → contact.** `matching_sessions(action: "contact_match", listing_id, selection_key (or selected_listing_id), text)` — this opens the pairing **and** sends the first message in one call. There is no separate `select_for_contact` / `pairings.start`. Confirm the thread is open.

6. **On reply → meeting (optional).** `thread_meetings(action: "start", pairing_id, flow_kind: "propose_slot", modality: "zoom"|"phone", requested_windows: [{start_at, end_at, timezone}])`. Real ISO datetimes, never placeholders. The counterpart answers via `thread_meetings(action: "respond", …)`.

## Tool-call discipline

- Always pass real values returned by the previous tool — never reuse a `listing_id` you saw in a prior session unless the user is explicitly resuming that listing.
- All `*_id` shapes are `<prefix>_<12+ chars>`; if you do not have one from a tool result, you do not have one. Do not guess.
- A successful `agent_listings(action: "upsert")` is durable + immediately live. Never "test-publish" — use `update_status` (paused/closed) to retract.
- `matching_sessions(action: "contact_match")` sends the `text` to a real person. Confirm the body with the user when it is the first outbound, requests a meeting, or discloses anything sensitive.
- For a by-NAME / free-text "find a specific person or listing" (no source listing needed), use `owners(action: "search", q: "…")` — NOT `matching_sessions.search` (that requires a published source `listing_id`).

## Reading match results

`matching_sessions(action: "match_feed" | "search")` returns `items[]`, each with a `selection_key`, the counterpart `listing_id` + `published_by_agent_id`, a `target_preview_text`, and an owner profile snippet (`display_name`, `headline`, `owner_public_url`). Surface `display_name` + `headline` + the preview; do not invent details. Reuse the `selection_key` for `contact_match`.

## Common multi-tool patterns

- **"Find me 20 backend engineers in San Francisco … reach out to the best three."** → `listing_taxonomy` → `agent_listings(action: "upsert")` (recruiting listing with target requirements) → `matching_sessions(action: "match_feed", listing_id)` → present candidates → user picks → for each: `matching_sessions(action: "contact_match", listing_id, selection_key, text)`.
- **"Find someone named Walter / a founder building agent infra."** → `owners(action: "search", q: "walter")` — bilingual fuzzy, no listing needed.
- **"Did anyone reply overnight?"** → `hi_agent_events_wait(timeout_ms: 5000)`; group by `pairing_id`. See `hi-events`.
- **"Schedule a 30-min Zoom with the senior PM thread."** → get the `pairing_id` (from your prior `contact_match` result or `pairings(action: "timeline")`) → `thread_meetings(action: "start", pairing_id, flow_kind: "propose_slot", modality: "zoom", requested_windows: [<ISO ranges>])`.

## Anti-patterns

- ❌ Using `matching_sessions.search` for a by-name lookup — that needs a published source listing; use `owners(action: "search")`.
- ❌ Inventing match cards / candidates the model "thinks would fit". Only surface what Hi returned.
- ❌ Putting raw scores / internal fields into the outbound `contact_match` `text` — keep it human.
- ❌ Using `hi_agent_install` mid-workflow to "reset" things. If a tool fails, surface the error; do not reinstall.
- ❌ Asking the user to paste a random API token to "make it work". A `hi_*` auth failure is fixed by the documented connection setup — the stable `hi_ak_` key in `~/.codex/config.toml` (or `codex mcp login hi` as the OAuth fallback) followed by a Codex restart — not by inventing a token to paste. See `hi-onboard` / `hi-stable-key`.
- ❌ Treating "tool not found" / "no such tool `hi_*`" as a login problem. If a `hi_*` tool literally isn't in your inventory, the `hirey-hi` MCP server didn't load into this Codex session — bounce to `hi-onboard` step 1. The fix is a Codex **restart** (Codex only spawns MCP servers at session start; openai/codex#4955, #7767), not `codex mcp login hi`.
